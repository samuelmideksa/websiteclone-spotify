            <h1><strong>Spotify User Guidelines</strong></h1>
            <p>Hello! Welcome to the Spotify User Guidelines ("<strong>User Guidelines</strong>") which apply when using Spotify's
                websites, applications and services that reference these User Guidelines (the "<strong>Services</strong>") including
                accessing any type of material or content made available through those Services ("<strong>Content</strong>"). These
                User Guidelines are designed to ensure the Services stay enjoyable for everyone. In addition to these User
                Guidelines, content must adhere to the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/platform-rules/plain/"><u>Spotify Platform
                        Rules</u></a> ("<strong>Platform Rules</strong>").</p>
            <p>We may update these User Guidelines and the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/platform-rules/plain/"><u>Platform
                        Rules</u></a> from time to time - you can find the latest version on our website.</p>
            <p>Violating the User Guidelines or <a href="https://www.spotify.com/platform-rules/plain/"><u>Platform Rules</u></a>
                may result in removal of any content or material you've contributed to the Services and/or termination or suspension
                of your account. We try to make the Services broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use our Services if we've
                previously terminated your account on any of our Services. We also prohibit attempts to circumvent prior enforcement
                actions, including through the creation of new accounts.</p>
            <p>The following is not permitted for any reason whatsoever in relation to the Services and the material or content made
                available through the Services, or any part thereof:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>reverse-engineering, decompiling, disassembling, modifying, or creating derivative works, except where such
                    restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law. If applicable law allows you to decompile any part of the
                    Services or Content where required in order to obtain the information necessary to create an independent program
                    that can be operated with the Services or with another program, the information you obtain from such activities
                    (a) may only be used for the foregoing objective, (b) may not be disclosed or communicated without Spotify's
                    prior written consent to any third party to whom it is not necessary to disclose or communicate in order to
                    achieve that objective, and (c) may not be used to create any software or service that is substantially similar
                    in its expression to any part of the Services or the Content;</li>
                <li>copying, reproducing, redistributing, "ripping," recording, transferring, performing, framing, linking to or
                    displaying to the public, broadcasting, or making available to the public, or any other use which is not
                    expressly permitted under the Agreements or applicable law, or which otherwise infringes intellectual property
                    rights;</li>
                <li>importing or copying any local files that you do not have the legal right to import or copy in this way;</li>
                <li>transferring copies of cached Content from an authorized Device to any other Device via any means;</li>
                <li>"crawling" or "scraping", whether manually or by automated means, or otherwise using any automated means
                    (including bots, scrapers, and spiders), to view, access or collect information;</li>
                <li>selling, renting, sublicensing, leasing or other monetization except as expressly permitted under the
                    Agreements;</li>
                <li>selling a user account or playlist, or otherwise accepting or offering to accept any compensation, financial or
                    otherwise, to influence the name of an account or playlist or the content included on an account or playlist; or
                </li>
                <li>artificially increasing play counts or follow counts, artificially promoting Content, or other manipulation
                    including by (i) using any bot, script or other automated process, (ii) providing or accepting any form of
                    compensation (financial or otherwise), or (iii) any other means;</li>
                <li>circumventing any technology used by Spotify, its licensors, or any third party, including any territorial or
                    other content access restrictions applied by Spotify or its licensors;</li>
                <li>circumventing or blocking advertisements or creating or distributing tools designed to block advertisements;
                </li>
                <li>removing or altering any copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property notices (including for the purpose
                    of disguising or changing any indications of ownership or source);</li>
                <li>deleting or altering any part of the Services or Content except as expressly permitted under the Agreements or,
                    in the case of Content made available by another user, with such user's express consent; or</li>
                <li>providing your password to any other person or using any other person's username and password.</li>
            </ol>

                    recording agreement or publishing agreement;</li>
                <li>includes your password or purposely includes any other user's password or purposely includes personal data of
                    third parties or is intended to solicit such personal data;</li>
