    <p>Hello, and welcome to Spotify's Cookie Policy ("Policy").</p>
    <p>The objective of this Policy is to provide you, as a user of Spotify's services, with clear and accessible
        information about the cookies that Spotify uses, the role they play in helping us provide the best possible
        experience to you and the choices you have when it comes to your cookie settings.</p>
    <h2><a id="1-what-are-cookies-and-other-similar-technologies"
            href="#1-what-are-cookies-and-other-similar-technologies">1. What are cookies and other similar
            technologies?</a></h2>
    <p>Cookies are text files which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. They are useful because they
        allow a website to recognise a user's device. You can find more information about cookies at: <a
            href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> or <a
            href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>.</p>
    <p>The term cookie actually describes a range of technologies, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>pixel tags (transparent graphic images placed on a web page or in an email, which indicate that a page or
            email has been viewed),</li>
        <li>mobile device identifiers, and</li>
        <li>web storage used in desktop software or mobile devices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We'll use the term cookie throughout this Policy to cover all of these technologies, but we'll make sure we
        provide you with clear details about them all so that you can make informed choices about your cookie settings.
    </p>
    <p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your
        preferences, and generally improving your user experience. They can also help to ensure that ads you see online
        are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
    <p>There are a few different categories of cookies, including:</p>
    <p>Session and Persistent Cookies</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Session Cookies - these are cookies which expire once you close your web browser; and</li>
        <li>Persistent Cookies - these are cookies which stay on your device for a set period of time or until you
            delete them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>First and Third Party Cookies</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First-party cookies - these are cookies set by the website that you are visiting at that time, either by us,
            or by a third party at our request;</li>
        <li>Third-party cookies - these are cookies that are set by a party other than that of the website you are
            visiting. If you visit the Spotify website or use the Spotify Service and another party sets a cookie
            through that website this would be a third-party cookie.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cookies also differ depending on the purpose they are used for, including:</p>

    <p>You can withdraw or modify your consent to our use of cookies at any time. If you no longer wish to receive
        cookies you can use your web browser settings to accept, refuse and delete cookies. To do this, follow the
        instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the "Help", "Tools" or "Edit" settings).</p>
    <p>Please note that if you set your browser to refuse cookies, you may not be able to use all the features of the

    <h4><a id="mobile-identifiers" href="#mobile-identifiers">Mobile Identifiers</a></h4>
    <p>On your mobile device, your operating system may provide you with additional options to opt out of interest based
        advertising or to otherwise reset your mobile identifiers. For example, you may use the "Limit Ad Tracking"
        setting (on iOS devices) or a setting to "Opt out of Interest-Based Ads" (on Android) which allows you to limit
        the use of information about your use of apps for purposes of serving ads targeted to your interests.</p>

    <p>You can withdraw your consent to our use of cookies on Spotify's desktop application at any time. If you no
        longer wish to receive cookies, navigate to your Account Settings page and turn on the Desktop Cookie Opt-Out
        feature. When the feature is turned on, it will block cookies from that installation of the Spotify desktop
        application on that computer; if you have Spotify installed on more than one machine, or if you re-install the
        application, then you will need to turn the feature on for each installation. You will need to restart the
        application for this feature to take effect.</p>

    <p>Certain targeted advertisements that we (or a service provider acting on our behalf) display to you based on
        information about your online activities across websites and other interactive properties operated by third
        parties may include the "Ad Choices" icon or another mechanism to opt out of receiving interest-based
