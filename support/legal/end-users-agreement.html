            <p>Please read these Terms of Use (these "<strong>Terms</strong>") carefully as they govern your use of (which includes
                access to) Spotify's personalized services for streaming music and other content, including all of our websites and
                software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms (collectively, the "<strong>Spotify Service</strong>")
                and any music, videos, podcasts, or other material that is made available through the Spotify Service (the
                "<strong>Content</strong>").</p>
            <p>Use of the Spotify Service may be subject to additional terms and conditions presented by Spotify, which are hereby
                incorporated by this reference into these Terms.</p>
            <p>By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these
                Terms, then you must not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.</p>
            <h4><a id="service-provider" href="#service-provider"><strong>Service Provider</strong></a></h4>
            <p>These Terms are between you and Spotify AB, Regeringsgatan 19, 111 53, Stockholm, Sweden.</p>

                are a minor in your home country, your parent or guardian will need to enter into these Terms on your behalf. You
                can find additional information regarding minimum age requirements in the registration process. If you do not meet
                the minimum age requirements then Spotify will be unable to register you as a user.</p>

            <h4><a id="spotify-service-options" href="#spotify-service-options"><strong>Spotify Service Options</strong></a></h4>
            <p>We provide numerous Spotify Service options. Certain Spotify Service options are provided free-of-charge, while other
                options require payment before they can be accessed (the "<strong>Paid Subscriptions</strong>"). We may also offer
                special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services. We
                are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.</p>
            <p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users. We will explain which services are available to you when you
                are signing up for the services. If you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription
                to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to
                re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service. Note that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which
                case you will no longer be charged for the Service.</p>
            <h4><a id="trials" href="#trials"><strong>Trials</strong></a></h4>
            <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without
                payment or at a reduced rate (a "<strong>Trial</strong>"). By using a Spotify Service via a Trial, you agree to the
                <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/premium-promotional-offer-terms/">Spotify Premium Promotional Offer

            <p>The Spotify Service may be integrated with, or may otherwise interact with, third-party applications, websites, and
                services ("<strong>Third-Party Applications</strong>") and third-party personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets,
                wearable devices, speakers, and other devices ("<strong>Devices</strong>"). Your use of such Third-Party
                Applications and Devices may be subject to additional terms, conditions and policies provided to you by the
                applicable third party. Spotify does not guarantee that Third-Party Applications and Devices will be compatible with

                        Limitations and Modifications</strong></a></h4>
            <p>We use reasonable care and skill to keep the Spotify Service operational and to provide you with a personalized,
                immersive audio experience. However, our service offerings and their availability may change from time to time and
                subject to applicable laws, without liability to you; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Spotify Service may experience temporary interruptions due to technical difficulties, maintenance or
                    testing, or updates, including those required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements.
                </li>
                <li>We aim to evolve and improve our Services constantly, and we may modify, suspend, or stop (permanently or
                    temporarily) providing all or part of the Spotify Service (including particular functions, features,
                    subscription plans and promotional offerings).</li>
                <li>Spotify has no obligation to provide any specific content through the Spotify Service, and Spotify or the
                    applicable owners may remove particular songs, videos, podcasts, and other Content without notice.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have prepaid fees directly to Spotify for a Paid Subscription that Spotify discontinues prior to the end of
                your Pre-Paid Period (as that term is defined in the Payments and cancellations section below), Spotify will refund
                you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period for any unused part of your then current Paid Subscription after such
                discontinuation. Your account and billing information must be up to date in order for us to refund you.</p>
            <p>Spotify has no liability to you, nor any obligation to provide a refund to you, in connection with internet or other
                service outages or failures that are caused by the actions of government authorities, other third parties or events
                beyond our control.</p>

            <p><u>Billing</u></p>
            <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior
                    to your purchase; or</li>
                <li>pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period ("<strong>Pre-Paid
                        Period</strong>").</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Tax rates are calculated based on the information you provide and the applicable rate at the time of your monthly
                charge.</p>
            <p>If you purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party, separate terms and conditions with such third
                party may apply to your use of the Spotify Service in addition to these Terms. If you purchase a Paid Subscription
                using a code, gift card, pre-paid offer, or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a
                Paid Subscription ("<strong>Codes</strong>"), you hereby agree to the Spotify <a
                    href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/gift-card/">Card Terms</a>.</p>
            <p><u>Price and tax changes</u></p>
            <p>Spotify may from time to time change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the
                Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes (defined above), and will communicate any price changes to you
                in advance on reasonable notice. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period
                following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, by continuing to use the Spotify Service after
                the price change takes effect, you will have accepted the new price. If you do not agree to a price change, you can
                reject the change by unsubscribing from the applicable Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into
                effect.</p>
            <p>Tax rates are based on the rates applicable at the time of your monthly charge. These amounts can change over time
                with local tax requirements in your country, state, territory or even city. Any change in Tax rate will be
                automatically applied based on the account information you provide.</p>
            <p><u>Renewal and Cancellation</u></p>
            <p>With the exception of Paid Subscriptions for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through
                which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period,
                unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period. Contact our
                Customer Support team <a href="https://support.spotify.com/contact-spotify-support/">here</a> for instructions on
                how to cancel. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and
                you will be downgraded to the free version of the Spotify Service. We do not provide refunds or credits for any
                partial subscription periods, except as expressly stated in these Terms.</p>
            <p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of
                the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Spotify Service.</p>
            <h4><a id="withdrawal-right" href="#withdrawal-right"><strong>Withdrawal right</strong></a></h4>
            <p>If you sign up for a Trial, you agree that the withdrawal right for the Paid Subscription for which you are receiving
                a Trial ends fourteen (14) days after you start the Trial. If you don't cancel the Paid Subscription before the
                Trial ends, you lose your right of withdrawal and authorise Spotify to automatically charge you the agreed price
                each month until you cancel the Paid Subscription. For trials less than fourteen (14) days, you expressly consent to
                us providing you with the paid service immediately after the end of your Trial and that from that point you lose
                your right of withdrawal.</p>
            <p>If you purchase a Paid Subscription with no Trial, you agree you have fourteen (14) days after your purchase to
                withdraw for any reason and must pay us for the services provided up until the time you tell us that you have
                changed your mind. You expressly consent to us providing you with the service immediately following your purchase,
                that you lose your right of withdrawal, and authorise Spotify to charge you automatically each month until you
                cancel.</p>
            <h4><a id="user-guidelines" href="#user-guidelines"><strong>User Guidelines</strong></a></h4>
            <p>We've established guidelines for using the Spotify Service, to make sure the Spotify Service stays enjoyable for
                everyone ("<strong>Spotify User Guidelines</strong>"). In using the Spotify Service, you must comply with the <a
                    href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/user-guidelines">Spotify User Guidelines</a>, as well as all applicable
                laws, rules, and regulation, and respect the intellectual property, privacy, and other rights of third parties.</p>
            <h4><a id="brand-accounts" href="#brand-accounts"><strong>Brand Accounts</strong></a></h4>
            <p>If you establish a Spotify account on behalf of a company, organization, entity, or brand (a
                "<strong>Brand</strong>," and such account a "<strong>Brand Account</strong>"), the terms "<strong>you</strong>" and
                "<strong>your</strong>," as used throughout these Terms (including other Spotify terms and conditions incorporated
                by reference herein), apply to both you and the Brand.</p>
            <p>If you create a Brand Account, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and
                licenses provided in these Terms (including any other applicable Spotify terms and conditions) and to bind the Brand
                to these Terms.</p>
            <p>A Brand may follow users and create and share playlists, provided that the Brand does not take any action that
                implies an endorsement or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or
                any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement. In addition,
                Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists,
                songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice
                when engaging in the foregoing practices.</p>

            <p>You agree to comply with all applicable export and reexport control laws and regulations, including without

                    Further, Spotify and all owners of the content disclaim any express, implied, and statutory warranties regarding
                    the content, including warranties of satisfactory quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or

                    explicit content filtering features, but use of these features may still result in some explicit content being
                    served and you should not rely on such features to filter all explicit content. This section applies to the

            <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of

            <p>If you are located in, are based in, have offices in, or do business in a jurisdiction in which this Section 6.3. is
                enforceable, the following mandatory arbitration provisions apply to you:</p>
            <h4><a id="631-dispute-resolution-and-arbitration" href="#631-dispute-resolution-and-arbitration"><strong>6.3.1 Dispute
                        resolution and arbitration</strong></a></h4>
            <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or
                relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based
                in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during
                or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual arbitration.
                Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF
                AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this
                agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator
                may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This
                arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.</p>
            <h4><a id="632-exceptions" href="#632-exceptions"><strong>6.3.2 Exceptions</strong></a></h4>
            <p>Notwithstanding clause 6.3.1 above, you and Spotify both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude,
                or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a small claims court ,(2)
                pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available,
                (3) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (4) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property
                infringement claims.</p>
            <h4><a id="633-arbitration-rules" href="#633-arbitration-rules"><strong>6.3.3 Arbitration rules</strong></a></h4>
            <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Spotify will be finally settled
                under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC") then in force (the "ICC Rules")
                by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules, as modified by these Agreements, and will be
                administered by the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC.</p>
            <p>Any arbitration will be conducted in the English language and unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a
                member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, the law to be applied in any arbitration shall be the
                law of [the relevant state or country described in clause 6.1], without regard to choice or conflicts of law
                principles.</p>
            <h4><a id="634-time-for-filing" href="#634-time-for-filing"><strong>6.3.4 Time for filing</strong></a></h4>
            <p>Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party
                asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim;
                and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law
                prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time
                period permitted by applicable law.</p>
            <h4><a id="635-notice-process" href="#635-notice-process"><strong>6.3.5 Notice; Process</strong></a></h4>
            <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified
                mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for
                you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). Spotify's address for Notice is: [Spotify, Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade
                Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA]. The Notice must (1) describe the nature
                and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good
                faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the
                Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any
                settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a
                final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor,
                Spotify shall pay you (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (2) the last written settlement amount
                offered by Spotify in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (3) $1,000.00, whichever is
                greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly
                confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the
                arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in
                confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.Except as required
                to enforce the arbitrator's decision and award, neither you nor Spotify shall make any public announcement or public
                comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the fact that the
                parties are in dispute, the existence of the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrator.</p>
            <h4><a id="636-modifications" href="#636-modifications"><strong>6.3.6 Modifications</strong></a></h4>
            <p>In the event that Spotify makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Spotify's
                address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to
                Spotify's address for Notice, in which case your account with Spotify shall be immediately terminated and this
                arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive.</p>
            <h4><a id="637-enforceability" href="#637-enforceability"><strong>6.3.7 Enforceability</strong></a></h4>
            <p>If the class action waiver at Section 6.2 is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if any part of this Section
                6.3 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 6.3 shall be null and void and, in
                such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 6.1 shall govern any
                action arising out of or related to the Agreements and you shall not be prevented from bringing proceedings at any
                time.</p>
            <h2><a id="7-about-these-terms" href="#7-about-these-terms">7. About these Terms</a></h2>
            <p>Under applicable law, you may have certain rights that can't be limited by a contract. These terms are in no way
                intended to restrict those rights.</p>
            <h4><a id="changes" href="#changes"><strong>Changes</strong></a></h4>
            <p>We may make changes to these Terms (including any additional Spotify terms and conditions incorporated by reference
                herein) from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means (before they take effect),
                including by posting a revised Agreement on the applicable Spotify Service (provided that, for material changes, we
                will seek to supplement such notice by email, an in-service pop-up message, or other means). Any such changes will
                not apply to any dispute between you and us arising prior to the date on which we posted the revised Terms, or other
                Spotify terms and conditions, incorporating such changes, or otherwise notified you of such changes. Your use of the
                Spotify Service following any changes to these Terms will constitute your acceptance of such changes. If you do not
                wish to continue using the Spotify Service under the updated Terms, you may terminate your account by contacting us.
                The effective date set forth at the top of this document indicates when these Terms were last changed.</p>

            <p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, these Terms
                constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in
                relation to the subject matter of these Terms, whether written or oral. As noted above, other terms and conditions

            <p>Unless as otherwise stated in these Terms, should any provision of these Terms be held invalid or unenforceable for
                any reason or to any extent, the remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected, and the application of
                that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.</p>
            <p>Any failure by Spotify or any third-party beneficiary to enforce these Terms or any provision thereof shall not waive
